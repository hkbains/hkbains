# About Project
- The project related to the conservation of the burrowing owls which are now classified as "species of concern" and relocating them to new homes.
- We wanted to understand the volunteering end to this activity and problems the volunteers face while rescuing the owls.
- We were a group of four master's students who researched this project in our Technical Communications course.

We researched together as a team and after analyzing the findings when went on to individually work on the potential solutions.

# Why are Burrowing Owls being rescued?
In Arizona, new construction has significantly diminished the colonies of burrowing animals where Burrowing Owls once nested by the hundreds. Pesticides, shooting, entanglement in loose fences, and similar manmade hazards are also major sources of mortality.

The Burrowing Owl is listed as Endangered in Canada, Threatened in Mexico, and a Species of Special Concern in Florida and much of the Western United States. As Arizona continues to grow, one of the greatest challenges is to minimize the impact of growth on displaced wildlife, and the use of artificial burrows is now helping to counter this threat.

# Visiting the Burrows!

# Surveys
To understand the volunteers are their demographic profiles we shared an online survey with the volunteers from a local volunteer organization - Wild At Hearts who are actively involved in the conservation of the owls.

The volunteers from this organization would help us understand the important issues faced during the conservation process.

# Survey Insights
- We used Qualtrics to conduct a short survey among 40+ volunteers.
- We found out that majority of the volunteers were within the age group of 55-74 years.
- A majority of females engaged in the volunteering activities, with only 5 participants identified as male and 36 as females.
- We invited interested participants for an online interview to learn more about their activities and the issues faced.

# Interviews
During the discovery phase of our project, we conducted user interviews in order to get a better understanding of the problem.
#### Interview Goals
- We choose to talk to the volunteers through zoom as it would help us to deeply understand their viewpoints.
- The research questions were centered around their likes and dislikes and any problems they faced that needed attention.
- We interviewed 5 people.
- We were curious about how they coordinated with each other or the coordinator.

# Personas
Based on the interviews/workshop we set up a persona. We referred to them throughout the entire product development process.

## Analyzing the volunteer's pain points!

# Concept and Usage Stories
Based on the data from surveys and user interviews, concept and usage stories were created to understand the journey of the users.

**What would new volunteers do? What should existing volunteers do?**

# What problems do they face?
1. No coordination platform to talk with each other or the coordinator.
2. The coordinator is the heart of the organization. If she is unavailable, it is hard to perform any activity.
3. Communication is done through only emails and calls. No scheduling application is used.

## Solution
A coordinating platform to add in their schedules for volunteering prior and then recieve volunteering requests filtered according to the set schedule.

Additionally, a resource list with all the training videos and new volunteer tasks list.

# Sketches
I usually start the design process with low-fidelity wireframes. This is the way I iterate through many design options quickly.
- Connecting the platform to the existing website.
- Adding a sign-up as a volunteer portal where people interested to volunteer can sign up.
- The coordinator would receive these requests and then move forward with the candidate for an interview.
- Adding a time scheduling feature that filters volunteering requests.
- Added an incentive that allows volunteers to earn badges by performing certain tasks.
- A resource list with training videos and a new volunteer task list.

## Lessons and Future Plans
# Users should be the center of your product
- Talking to the users in-depth and getting their viewpoint before you start brainstorming about the potential solutions is a great way to come up with a product that would be useful for the users.
- Sometimes, the users won't know they require a product until they are introduced to that product.
- Testing this platform would be my next step. This would help me understand if this product adds value to the volunteer's everyday tasks or not.
