Currently pursuing a Master's Degree in User Experience at Arizona State University. I love working in an interdisciplinary team and creating a better experience by researching what the users want.

I love chatting about paintings, illustrations, food places, or the latest fashion trends. :sparkles:

# UX Design
My graduate degree helped me dive into the User research of the design process in depth while creating semester-wide research projects on various topics.

# Prototyping
Working at a web and app development company taught me a lot about how to understand users, solve problems and build great products.

# Visual Design
My undergraduate degree has equipped and helped me to have an eye for design. Colors, typography, layout, and the whole package.

# When I am not working
If you can't find me at my computer, I'm either in the library, shopping, or just out for a walk enjoying the sun.

Other than UX, I like creating illustrations and portraits. You can even find me clicking photographs of random things I find fascinating.
